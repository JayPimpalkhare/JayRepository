                <p class="lead fw-normal text-light" style="font-size: 20px ; padding-top: 20px;">As a child I would
                    spend most of my time
                    outside playing around in
                    the piles
                    of scrap metal and paraphernalia my grandfather had lying around our farm. I would often tinker
                    around with these and make abstract sculptures or monsters or organise them in a mosaic like
                    pattern
                    in hopes of making, what seemed to me at the time, a large scale piece of art like I saw on my
                    favourite t.v shows like MAD with Rob. This sparked in me the passion and desire for
                    hands-on-work
                    and creating things that not only had meaning in my eyes but also something that represented an
                    idea
                    to others.

                    This is why I have chosen communication design as a preferred course to specialise in at the
                    undergrad level. I have a passion for depicting ideas, thoughts and emotions visually and
                    articulating my concepts through the use of symbolism and would like to build on these skills.
